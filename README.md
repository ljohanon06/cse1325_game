Copy everything in to directory and use these commands to run

javac -d bin *.java

java Main.java

It should run, there is an example NPC in there with explanations of all the field, make sure it matches that exactly

Just change the values in the maps, the file names are specific, if you have more npcs, just add more files and keep the naming conventions

Don't change the code, ctrl+c will quit out, you might have to click on the terminal before it will quit

If you click off the terminal or on the terminal, make sure you click back onto the program that opens up at the bottom of your screen with the java mug logo

Don't be stupid please
